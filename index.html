          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>
            Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
            traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for
            example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is
            whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the
            student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of
            critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination.
            These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve
            forms of education. The term can also refer to the mental states and
            qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic
            field studying education.
